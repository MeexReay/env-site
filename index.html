    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to ENV — a bold and experimental tech company building a different kind of mobile experience. 📱⚡

We don't follow trends. We question them. Every device we create, from the flagship models to budget-friendly versions, reflects our passion for original design, custom hardware, and transparent tech.

At the heart of ENV is our own software platform — HuesOS — running on our custom-made processors like the Hues CPU5 series. 🔧💡 Our chip names aren't just marketing fluff — each number tells you the architecture, quality, and performance level. No secrets here. 🤝

We design phones that feel personal. Whether it’s mirrored buttons, unusual camera layouts, or a full UI overhaul, nothing is done "just because." Even small changes — like moving a flashlight or simplifying a logo — are part of a bigger goal: tech that feels intentional.

Our UI, HuesUI, is minimal, bold, and constantly evolving. 🧪 Every update is shaped by feedback from our users — because you're not just customers, you're part of the experiment. 💬🔄

ENV is not about mass appeal. It's about building devices that stand out, function simply, and challenge the way tech is “supposed” to be. If you’re tired of copy-paste design and bloated software, you're one of us already.

Join the ENV movement.
We’re not perfect — we’re real. And we’re just getting started. 🚀</p>
